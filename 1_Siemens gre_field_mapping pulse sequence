Field map data from the Siemens pulse sequence takes the form of one phase difference map, and two magnitude images, one for each echo time.
The best looking magnitude image is used for registration and masking. However, the process is not particularly sensitive to the quality and typically either image will work fine.
The phase difference map needs some post processing (through available FSL tools) to extract the correctly calibrated fieldmap in units of rad/s.
