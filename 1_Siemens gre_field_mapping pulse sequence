(1) Any multi-echo gradient echo pulse sequence can be used for B0 field mapping. However, Siemens predefined pulse sequence can be easily employed for this purpose.

(2) Siemens gre_field_map pulse sequence, collects two sets of images at two different echo times (i.e. by default with a 2.46ms echo time difference) per scan.

(3) Field map data from the Siemens pulse sequence takes the form of one phase difference map, and two magnitude images, one for each echo time.

(4) The directly generated phase difference map can be used for qualitative purposes right at the console.

(5) The phase difference map needs some post processing (through available FSL tools) to extract the correctly calibrated fieldmap in units of rad/s.
