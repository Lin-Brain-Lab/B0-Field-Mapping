(1) Any multi-echo gradient echo pulse sequence can be used for B0 field mapping. 

(2) However, Siemens predefined pulse sequence (i.e. gre_field_map) can be easily employed for this purpose.

(3) Siemens pulse sequence, collects two sets of images at two different echo times (i.e. by default with a 2.46ms echo time difference) per scan.

(4) Field map data from the Siemens pulse sequence takes the form of one phase difference map, and two magnitude images, one for each echo time.

(5) The generated phase difference map can be directly used on the console for qualitative analysis.

(6) For quantitatve analyses, such as EPI image undistortion, the generated phase difference map needs to be post-processed (e.g. through the available FSL tools) 
to extract the correctly calibrated fieldmap in units of rad/s.

(7) The magnitude images are also used for brain extraction (i.e. filtering the background noise), as a part of the field map reconstruction process.
